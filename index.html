 <h2>Taye-Vaughn Jones</h2>
 <p>I am a third year student at the University of the West Indies, pursuing a Computer Science major and a Mathematics minor. I enjoy coding, watching football and I love to learn! I am interested in web development because I am a creator - I love creating things and watching my code come to life. I think web development is super important because the web is everywhere and by learning to develop webpages, I will be able to supply an essential service.</p>
